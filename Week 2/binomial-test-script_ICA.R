#### This is a script ####

# There are a few differences you want to take note of in a script
#   1. Formatting isn't a thing, it's either code or not
#   2. Text is made in the same way as in a markdown, with the symbol # in front
#   3. There is no setup chunk. Imagine this is just a long version of the console
